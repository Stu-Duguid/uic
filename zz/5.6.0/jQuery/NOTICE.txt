The jQuery flavor of the UIC is being deprecated.

All new integrations of the UIC should use the W3C flavor. Existing web
applications using the jQuery flavor of the UIC should plan for updating
to the W3C flavor as soon as possible.

How do I know if my application is using the jQuery flavor of the UIC?
Fewer than 5% of Tealeaf integrations use the jQuery flavor of the UIC.
Your web application is only impacted if you are using the jQuery flavor
of the UIC. To determine the flavor of the UIC, look for the IBM Copyright
message in your UIC file. The jQuery flavor will have a copyright message
with the last line containing "@flags jQuery" like the following:

/*!
* Licensed Materials - Property of IBM
* © Copyright IBM Corp. 2017
* US Government Users Restricted Rights - Use, duplication or disclosure restricted by GSA ADP Schedule Contract with IBM Corp.
*
* @version 5.4.1.1813
* @flags jQuery,NDEBUG
*/

Alternatively, load the web application with which the UIC is integrated
and open Developer Tools. In the Console, type "TLT.getFlavor()" to obtain
the UIC flavor.

What will happen if I do nothing?
Your current integration will continue to function. However, you may not be
able to take advantage of the latest enhancements to the product. At some
point in the future support for the jQuery flavor will stop entirely.

Please consult with your Professional Services representative for further
guidance.
